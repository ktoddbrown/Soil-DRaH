The purpose of this document is to summarize the portions of the United States Geological Survey's AHorizons Database that are relevant to data collections in the SoilDRaH project and walk through the data ingestion.
Here you will find links to documentation from the data provider, links to where you can access the data, a description of how the data was processed, and visuals for the collection relevant variables.

Below is the download link to the data. It needs to be put in a better format before it can be used to gather data annotations.
